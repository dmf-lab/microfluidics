# microfluidics
Repository for Autodesk Fusion add-in and Ultimaker Cura profiles as part of the work by Felton, Hughes and Diaz-Gaxiola into 3D printing microfluidic channels.

We are aware of an issue that stops the Fusion files from being generated correctly. This is caused by delays in Fusion processing the computations required to generate the geometry. We are investigating a way of overcoming this. In the meantime, please try generating the code on alternative hardware, creating from source (please see the resources folder) or reaching out for assistance.
